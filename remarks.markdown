### Description

Most DRAMATIC Ruby code EVER!

The source code expresses a adventure story: a man enters the tower and solves mysteries. Optical illusions make him crazy. The program returns true because it's a true story.

### Usage

    ruby entry.rb

### Portability

I've tested with the followings.

* ruby 2.0.0p0 (2013-02-24 revision 39474) [x86_64-darwin12.2.1]
* ruby 1.9.3p392 (2013-02-22 revision 39386) [x86_64-darwin12.2.1]
* ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [i686-linux]
* ruby 2.0.0p0 (2013-02-24) [x64-mingw32]

It does not work with Ruby 1.8.*.

### Internals

* Short-circuit

### Limitations

To view the code requires 

* a Japanese monospace font 
* a text editor supporting Japanese characters

Most recent OSs support these things.
With OS X, cat command is the best way to view the code neatly.
